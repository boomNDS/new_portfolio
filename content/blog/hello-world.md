# Hello World!

Welcome to my new portfolio website! I've been wanting to build something like this for a while, and I'm excited to finally share it.

## What This Site Is

This is more than just a portfolio—it's a place where I can:

- **Showcase my work**: Projects I've built, both professional and personal
- **Share dev logs**: Document my development journey in real-time
- **Write learning notes**: Solidify my understanding by teaching others
- **Blog**: Random thoughts, tutorials, and experiences

## The Tech Stack

- **Nuxt 3**: Full-stack Vue framework
- **Nuxt Content**: File-based CMS for dev logs and learning notes
- **UnoCSS**: Atomic CSS engine
- **Motion V**: Smooth animations

## What's Next?

I'll be regularly updating this site with:
1. Progress on my current projects
2. Tutorials on technologies I'm learning
3. Thoughts on software engineering

Thanks for stopping by!
